1. Multiply the first digit of both numbers here it is, 5 * 9 = 45 add two zero. </br>
-> **4500**  
2. Multiply the number 56 and second digit of second multiplier i.e 5 </br>
-> **56 * 5 = 280**
3. Multiply 95 and second digit of first multiplier i.e 6 </br> 
-> **95 * 6 = 570**
4. Add all the answers you got. </br>
-> **5350**
5. Multiply the second digit of both numbers i.e 6 * 5 and subtract the resultant number </br>
-> **-30**
</br>

***Ans: 5320***

> There are two benefits of this method let's start with first one. </br>
> The pattern.

I would be uploading few images and texts which shows how this method acts as a pattern for finding next number or it's factors, relationship between those numbers and the mystery of using subtraction and the subtraction resulting into yet another pattern for finding next number.
</br>

> The second benefit is not much great for average person, but if you can calcuate some numbers in head this method provides you with a speed boost.

</br>
</br>


***The method can be written mathematically as:***
<br>

Let A1.B1 and A2.B2 be two inputs,
</br>
f(A1B1 x A2B2) =  A1 x A2 x 100 </br> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;+                 A1.B1 x B2 <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;+                 A2.B2 x B1 <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;-                 A1 x A2 <br> <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; = **answer**
<br>
<br>

> The multiplication of A1 & A2 with the number 100 depends on the question if it was a 3_3 multiplication you would use 1000 instead of hundred and so on.<br>
But at this point doing 3_3 multiplication with this method is not a good choice to go.<br>

> The steps from A1.B1 x B2 shows a pattern of numbers between different multiplications, which we will get back to later.
